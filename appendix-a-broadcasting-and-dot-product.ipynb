    "\n",
    "- Rule 1: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
    "- Rule 2: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
    "- Rule 3: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised."
